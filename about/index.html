<p>The blog for the ChatScrypt project! Initiated in 2019, by two non-expert but technically-educated developers, as a part-time late-night hobby (managing expectations here). Goals for the project:

<ul>
<li> A chat client featuring....

<li> zero-trust security, encryption, and transparency,

<li> user-friendly, searchable chat transcription,

<li> speed and simplicity,

<li> a highly customizable platform,

<li> and portability across multiple devices and platforms.
</ul>

ChatScrypt = Chat + encryption + tranScription.
