I took a couple of days off posting, finishing off the actual (though still basic) chat feature of ChatScrypt. There were multiple design choices I made that merit discussion. For this post, I would like to discuss how ChatScrypt currently maintains a coherent chat session through intermittent internet reconnection events, due for instance to an unstable wifi or data connection, or the user's own switching of wifi or data networks. These events should be common, for instance on a mobile device.

The goals are to
<ul>
  <li> preserve offline usability to the greatest extent possible,
  <li> and have a seamless continuation of communications once a reconnection is established. 
</ul>

Philosophically, obtaining security and stability coincide nicely, since both require me to keep an eye on each time a signal is sent from the client/broser to the server. It is convenient to think about the client as an offline program, sending and receiving messages to and from the server on rare occasions. At the moment, aside from login and logout, I have isolated communications into three situations:

<ul>
<li> adding users to your contact list,
<li> sending messages,
<li> and receiving messages.
</ul>
      
<p> I have adopted a straightforward solution: All data sent to the server is also queued at the same time; it is removed from the queue if the successful delivery of the data is confirmed (currently, the confirmation takes the form of a "boomerang" signal from the server). On every reconnection, all data in queues is emitted again.

There are a few small design choices underlying each case above:

<h2>The Contact List</h2>

This is actually a bit controversial and subject to change, due to the question of whether it is secure to store all of a user's interactions with other users in one list. I decided to include one for now, because:

<ul>
<li> At the moment it is convenient as simply a way to isolate the matter of verifying whether a username/contact matches an existing account, as this requires confirmation from the server. I can handle this carefully and in an isolated way, queuing requests locally and sending verification requests from this queue (similar to the message queue below). The benefit is that the more important and frequent task of message drafting becomes a purely local/offline matter, hence entirely robust across reconnection events.

<li> The (future) feature of autocompleting past recipients is too convenient to pass over and requires a contact list one way or another. 

<li> I actually haven't thought or read much about the possibility of a chat client that can perform its duties with no awareness of who is talking to who. I'm not sure it's possible. (I could simply promise not to save contact information into a database, but I think that promise is weak enough that the former two usability points win.)
</ul>


  <h2>Sending Messages</h2>

Uncontroversial as far as I can tell: Rather than emitting messages directly, I stage them in a message queue locally/offline, and remove them as the server confirms successful receipt. Currently, the message queue is visually implemented via italics (the standard font is restored after a successful send).

<p>Note: If a chat window is closed, its corresponding message queue is erased.

  <h2>Receiving Messages</h2>

I had some design choices to make here:

<ul>
<li> In the style of email, and in contrast to services like Gchat, chat windows can only be opened by the user (in Gchat and I believe other apps, a new message will automatically pop open a new chat window). Instead, also similar to email, the list of chats updates real-time. The philosophy is that windows should not appear unprompted, especially where the user might be actively clicking. As a happy side effect, this sidesteps the many issues of new incoming chats during internet downtime.

<li>Already-open chat windows do receive messages real-time, of course. On reconnection events, they reload messages from the database (and hence load any messages that would have been received during any downtime).
</ul>
