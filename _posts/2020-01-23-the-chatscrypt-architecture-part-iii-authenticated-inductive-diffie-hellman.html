I came up with the Authenticated Inductive Diffie-Hellman (AIDH) protocol as I finished up <a href="https://chatscrypt.github.io/2020/01/20/the-chatscrypt-architecture-part-ii-repeated-triple-diffie-hellman">Part II</a> in this series, solving the issues I realized as I was analyzing R2DH (you might call AIDH the "R2D2 protocol"). In addition, as far as I can tell, it has all the properties advertised of the Signal protocol on Wikipedia: "confidentiality, integrity, authentication, participant consistency, destination validation, forward secrecy, post-compromise security (aka future secrecy), causality preservation, message unlinkability, message repudiation, participation repudiation, and asynchronicity." Let's briefly go through them:
<ul>
<li> Confidentiality: Messages are encrypted and can only be read by Alice and Bob.
<li> Integrity: If an attacker modifies a message ciphertext, it is completely destroyed.
<li> Authentication: Alice can prove she has the private key of a long-term public key known to be Alice's, authenticating herself. (The public key needs to be verified by Bob externally, in real life.)
<li> Participant consistency: For pairwise conversations, this is automatic from authentication.
<li> Destination validation: To be honest I'm not sure what this means, but Alice eventually knows whether Bob received her message.
<li> Forward secrecy: Old ciphertexts have keys that are not obtainable from future keys.
<li> Future secrecy: The current key is not derivable from past keys.
<li> Causality preservation: Information about the order of messages is encrypted along with the messages.
<li> Message unlinkability: Breaking one message compromises none of the security properties of another message. 
<li> Message repudiation (deniability): Bob may publish a message but Alice may claim it was forged or modified.
<li> Participation repudation (strong deniability): Same as message repudiation, but for whole conversations.
<li> Asynchronicity: Alice can sent messages to a mailbox for Bob; he doesn't need to be there.
</ul>

<p>The AIDH protocol is simpler than the Signal protocol and achieves equivalent or superior security (see <a href="https://chatscrypt.github.io/2020/01/20/the-chatscrypt-architecture-part-ii-repeated-triple-diffie-hellman">Part II</a> for some of the mild advantages). I will present AIDH using an inductive "finite state machine" exposition (someone should really do the same for Signal).

<h2>Alice's state</h2>

<p>Once the protocol is initiated, between messages Alice will have:
<ul>
<li>The number of messages she has sent so far, and a list of integers enumerating which of Bob's messages she has received so far. (The contiguous part stemming from 0 may be deleted.) The list should typically be length 1.
<li>A list of her most recent private encryption keys, with newest key <b>x</b> and oldest key <b>x'</b>. Typically long, if Alice has been sending a lot of messages, and short if Bob recently messaged.
<li>A list of Bob's most recent public encryption keys, with newest key <b>g^y mod N</b>. Typically long, with length equal to how many messages Bob has sent without Alice's reply.
</ul>

<p>In the alternative/augmented implementation discussed at the end, there would be no need for lists.


<h2>Initialization</h2>
Bob publishes to the server a new signed public key <b>g^y mod N</b>. He refreshes this key every time someone initiates a new correspondence with him. Alice publishes to the server an unsigned but long-term public key <b>g^a mod N</b>.

<p>When Alice wants to initiate a correspondence with Bob, she fetches Bob's signed public key, verifies the signature, and sends some metadata to Bob using the shared Diffie-Hellman encryption key
<div class="media">
<b>g^(ay) mod N.</b>
</div>

Alice then initalizes her state:
<ul>
<li>She creates an empty list of integers.
<li>Alice's private key list is initialized with <b>x = a</b>.
<li>Bob's public key list is initialized with <b>g^y mod N</b>.
</ul>

When Bob receives the first message, he intializes as follows: 
<ul>
<li>He creates a list of integers initialized with 1.
<li>Bob's private key list is initialized with <b>y</b>.
<li>Alice's public key list is initialized with <b>g^a mod N</b>.
</ul>

<h2>Sending a message</h2>
Alice creates a new Diffie-Hellman key pair with private key <b>x</b> and encrypts her message using the shared Diffie-Hellman encryption keys 
<div class="media">
<b>g^(xy) mod N</b> and <b>g^(x'y) mod N</b>.
</div>

She attaches the following to her message:
<ul>
<li> (unencrypted) The public keys <b>g^x, g^x', g^y mod N</b>. The latter two may be excluded, especially in the alternative implementation discussed below, where there are much fewer stored keys to "try out."
<li> (encrypted) The message number, the number of messages Bob has sent Alice (0 if not contiguous), and for padding, perhaps a timestamp.
</ul>

<p>Alice then updates her state:
<ul>
<li>She increments her message count.
<li>She pushes <b>x</b> to her list of recent private keys.
</ul>

<h2> Receiving a message</h2>

For authentication, Bob searches for <b>x'</b> in his list of Alice's public keys. He searches for <b>y</b> in his list of private keys. He decrypts the message and updates his state as follows if the message number and timestamp are sensible.

<ul>
<li>He pushes the message number to his list of integers. If the list is contiguous from the beginning, he can empty the list. If either the list is not contiguous, or Alice's side is not contiguous, or Alice has received fewer messages than Bob has sent, a flag is raised.
<li>If the messages were contiguous, Bob may delete all of his private keys (strictly) before <b>y</b>. (Alice has seen it, so from now on all of her messages will use <b>y</b> or a newer key.)
<li>Bob pushes the new key <b>g^x mod N</b> into his list of Alice's public keys. If the messages were contiguous, he may delete all of Alice's public keys (strictly) before <b>x'</b>.
</ul>

<h2>Alternative implementation</h2>

The reason we maintain lists of keys as opposed to single keys is to handle delayed and out-of-order messages. This implementation is good if you are more worried about forward and future secrecy than key storage: All keys are refreshed with optimal expediency. With respect to key storage, I should remark that the private keys in AIDH are entirely independent, fresh from a random number generator, so the above implementation is no less secure than Signal already, which also stores old (independent) keys in pathological situations.

<p> For those worried about storing so many keys however, we describe an alternative implementation, which keeps key lists each at bounded length. The idea is to update which of Bob's public keys Alice uses, very judiciously. She will persist in using the same old key of Bob's, but with every message she will ask for permission to update to a new public key - the newest public key of Bob's that she has seen. She requests the same key until Bob replies to this specific request, either affirmatively or negatively. If negatively, then she simply moves on to request another key - the newest that she has seen.
  
<p>Bob will approve the request if he still has the requested private key on hand AND has received all of Alice's messages up to the message attached to the current request; he will decline if not. In the typical case, the most recent key Alice has seen is the key Bob has most recently used, so he should still have it.
  
<p>This implementation has just the slightest weakening of forward and future secrecy: Alice's recipient key <b>y</b> update requires one extra exchange, and further may fail to update if Bob "squeezes in" a message in the split second before her permission request reaches him. The advantage is that Alice keeps only five keys at any time: 
  
<ul>
<li>The public key of Bob's which she uses currently.
<li>The recent public key of Bob's which Alice is/will shortly request to replace the previous key.
<li>The private key of Alice's which Bob uses currently.
<li>The recent private key of Alice's which Bob might request to replace the previous key.
<li>The previous private key of Alice's that Bob used. This is because, when Alice accepts Bob's request, she has no way of knowing if there are still some incoming messages, using this old private key. 
</ul>

In some sense, the original implementation is more secure, as using new keys is more secure than older keys: Storing keys allows us to pick the newest key possible at any time. On the other hand, this could be a lot of keys to store, even with typical usage: If Alice sends a lot of contiguous messages, the key lists on both sides of the conversation grow proportionately. As a result, for ChatScrypt, I think this alternative implementation is more appropriate.
