The blog for the <a href="https://chatscrypt.herokuapp.com/">ChatScrypt</a> project! Initiated in 2019, by two non-expert but technically-educated developers, as a part-time late-night hobby (trying to manage expectations here). Goals for the project:

<ul>
<li> To build a chat client featuring:

<li> zero-trust security, encryption, and transparency,

<li> user-friendly, searchable message transcription,

<li> speed and simplicity,

<li> a highly customizable interface,

<li> and portability across multiple devices and platforms.
</ul>

ChatScrypt = Chat + encryption + tranScription. 

<p> (But mainly, I was able to get a gmail address for this name: Contact us at chatscrypt at gmail, or comment below.)
