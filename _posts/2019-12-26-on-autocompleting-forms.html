Or: Why autocomplete will be turned off for forms on ChatScrypt, at every opportunity.

<p>There is a nice discussion on the security of autocomplete <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/49326/should-websites-be-allowed-to-disable-autocomplete-on-forms-or-fields">here</a>.

<p>The gist of it is that unfortunately, autocomplete is an umbrella term for two distinct features, one of which is useful (even beneficial to security); the other of which is insecure, or risky at best:

<ul>
<li>Repetitive (same-site) autocomplete: Autocomplete that sees you filling out an identical form, on the same site, repeatedly, and does it for you (often at your request). Having this feature is not just convenient: It also protects against phishing, as an imposter bank website will not autocomplete fields when the true site would; the crickets are an implicit tip from the browser to the user that something is fishy.
  
<li> Predictive (often cross-site) autocomplete: Autocomplete that reads the field entry prompt, say, "Email:", remembers all the other times, including on other sites, you have filled in an Email field, and offers them as suggestions. This is the bad kind of autocomplete.
</ul> 

For ChatScrypt, I have decided to turn off autocomplete at every opportunity, because:

<ul>
<li> It seems that reputable browsers have now established a proper distinction between the two forms of autocomplete. Autocomplete is now synonymous with the predictive, "bad" kind, and so the decision was easy. (The "good" kind is probably referred to as something like "password management.")

<li> Autocomplete is not forgiving of typos: If I mistype my username once, the typo is always re-offered until I dig into browser settings to erase the typo.

<li> In instances where autocomplete actually would be useful (eg. search), I would rather implement it on my own in a more transparent way than what modern browsers and sites (eg. Gmail) currently provide. 
</ul>
