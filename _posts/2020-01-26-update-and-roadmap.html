I got tired of reading yesterday and so had some fun touching up the current implementation: First changes since Decmber 29th. I added some minor features including:
<ul>
<li> Resizing and rearranging panels for space efficiency.
<li> Clicking on names in contact list opens a new chat with the name preloaded as recipient.
<li> Chat names are no longer name-[mysteriousinteger].
<li> Timestamps are now hidden, instead appearing as alt-text.
<li> An interesting feature I stole from Gchat: Highlighting text in a chat window behaves as you would expect, but clicking on the text focuses the cursor on the text entry box.
</ul>

This is all part of step one in the following rough order of tasks I have in mind:
<ul>
<li> Usability, enough to keep me sane as I debug (almost there).
<li> Encryption.
<li> Message storage (in the cloud, encrypted).
<li> Server security (rate limiting, XSS attacks, account recovery).
<li> Search.
<li> Display style and customization.
<li> Voice, image, video...emojis?
</ul>

At this stage, all are fairly straightforward - like filling in a coloring book, as I say - except for search, and possibly account recovery if I can come up with some new ideas there. After message storage, this begins to become useful.
