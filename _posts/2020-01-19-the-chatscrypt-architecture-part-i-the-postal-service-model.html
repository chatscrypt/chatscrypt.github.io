It's easy to forget that initially, instant messaging services did not support offline messages. You could only send an instant message to someone if they were simultaneously online, operating like two-way radio. It was only fairly recently that email became a reasonably apt model for instant messaging.

<p>In this sense, it is not too surprising that we (or at least I) still think of an instant messaging client as a network hub, as opposed to a postal delivery service. However, given the growing interest in privacy and security in recent years, it makes sense to finally shift to the postal service model. Networks are inherently public, while postal delivery is inherently private.

<p> Much of the following is motivated by the "sealed sender" feature recently implemented in Signal.

<h2>The model</h2>

We will use the model of a postal delivery system where individuals can request a personal mailbox, with a mail slit. Each mailbox has a publicly known address, but a key owned only by the individual. The postal service can only push mail through mail slits; it cannot open personal mailboxes.

<p>The postal service has a central collection with a "dark dropoff area," where individuals can drop off envelopes anonymously. The envelopes are marked only by a recipient address. No return address is needed.

<p>Individuals can check their personal mailboxes at any time. These are well-lit, so the public can see how much mail any individual is getting. Inside each envelope is a letter with the signature of the sender. Note that the sender does not necessarily have a personal mailbox. However, anyone may stop by central collection and check a public list of signatures matching those with personal mailboxes. Letters with unregistered or fake signatures may be discarded.


<h2>The implementation</h2>

I should first point out that this model is at the moment mostly theoretical. For instance, the practical separation between a user as a recipient and a user as a sender is essentially destroyed by IP tracking, browser metadata, etc. Further, none of the below is yet implemented in ChatScrypt (and hence is tentative).

<p>Currently, ChatScrypt runs using web sockets. When Alice connects to ChatScrypt, a "recipient socket" will initiate and request authentication. Once Alice is authenticated, the server will send her encrypted messages meant for her, along with a password-encrypted bundle of Alice's identity and short term keys (I will discuss the details of the encryption in Part II). Alice may use these keys to decrypt the messages and signatures. The signatures may be validated using a public database of public identity keys.

<p>When Alice decides to send a message, a second, independent "sender socket" will initiate, without requesting authentication. Alice will need to fetch public keys of individuals to whom she would like to send messages, or recall shared secret keys for ongoing conversations, and use these with her private keys to encrypt her messages and signatures.
