Not long after my previous post in this series, I realized I had actually simply rediscovered a version of the Off-the-Record (OTR) protocol, missing the whole point of the Signal protocol. It turns out that the Signal protocol does not improve upon OTR that much: It offers only the slight improvement in that with typical usage, keys that can decrypt any message are deleted very quickly, on <i>both</i> Alice and Bob's devices. This is done via a KDF chain, not quite reusing the same <b>y</b> of Bob's. OTR as I formulated it through IDHEA does very good key updates on Alice's device, but not Bob's. You could argue that neither is better than the other, but Signal is correct in that any extra security one can get on Bob's device is very desirable, as Alice has no control over it.

<p>So, well-played, Signal. I realize now why it has become a sort of standard in the industry. In some ways, it does seem optimal. Still, I've got one more trick up my sleeve.

<h2>A flaw in the Signal protocol</h2>

<p>There is one very realistic use-case where Signal fails to provide much improvement over using a fixed encryption key. This is the setting where Alice sends many messages to Bob, but Bob never replies. For instance, airlines often text you your flight status and information, and typically you have no reason to reply to the airline. (Further, your flight information is relatively sensitive and actually worth protecting.) In such a communication, Signal will never increment its DH ratchet, becoming equivalent to a simple KDF-chain protocol (I believe this simple protocol was taken by Signal from something called SCIMP). Admittedly, this provides some forward secrecy, but no future secrecy.

<h2>The Postal Diffie-Hellman</h2>

<p>Here is the problem with Signal: It is building on protocols designed for peer-to-peer messaging - like the old AIM, where offline messages were not available. But Signal is not a peer-to-peer platform. It is centralized, with a server. Signal essentially does not take advantage of this, other than to store offline messages.

<p>Let me approach end-to-end encryption from a new angle, asking how we can take advantage of the server - essentially, a postal delivery hub. 

<h2>Alice's state</h2>

After the protocol has initiated, Alice has the following state:

<ul>
<li>Alice's current private key <b>x</b>, and pending private key <b>x*</b> waiting for confirmation from Bob.
<li>Bob's current public key <b>y</b>, and previous public key <b>y'</b> in case Alice has processed the update to <b>y</b>, but Bob is unaware and still sending <b>y'</b> encrypted messages.
<li>A binary set to whether Alice has received a message from Bob since her last message.
</ul>


<h2>Bob's state</h2>

Bob will have the same state but in reverse:

<ul>
<li>Bob's current private key <b>y</b>, and pending private key <b>y*</b> waiting for confirmation from Alice.
<li>Alice's current public key <b>x</b>, and previous public key <b>x'</b> in case Bob has processed the update to <b>x</b>, but Alice is unaware and still sending <b>x'</b> encrypted messages.
<li>A binary set to whether Bob has received a message from Alice since his last message. (Not needed in the logic of Alice sending to Bob.)
</ul>

<h2>The server's state</h2>

<p>The server will have Bob's pending public key <b>y*</b> encrypted with the shared encryption key <b>g^(xy) mod N</b>.


<h2>Initialization</h2>

Bob publishes to the server a public key <b>y</b>. He refreshes this key every time he comes online, and while online, every time someone new initiates a stream of messages to him. 

<p>When Alice wants to initiate a stream of messages to Bob, she fetches Bob's public key and initializes her state:
<ul>
<li>Alice sets <b>x, x*</b> to the same new DH key pair.
<li>Both of Bob's public keys are set to <b>y</b>. 
<li>The binary is set to false.
</ul>
Alice then sends a message to the server with her new <b>x*</b>, encrypted with key <b>g^(xy) mod N</b>. (Not needed in the logic of Alice sending to Bob.)

<p>If Bob is online, his initialization is straightforward. Alice sends an initial message to Bob with her public key <b>x</b>. Bob initializes his state in the same way, in reverse:
<ul>
<li>Bob sets <b>y</b> to his published DH key pair and saves a new DH key pair to <b>y*</b>, checking to ensure it is distinct.
<li>Both of Alice's public keys are set to <b>x</b>. 
<li>The binary is set to false.
</ul>
Bob then sends a message to the server with his new <b>y*</b>, encrypted with key <b>g^(xy) mod N</b>.

<p>If Bob is offline, note that the initialization can all be done by the server and Alice, provided they set <b>y* = y</b>. The private key <b>y</b> needs to be delayed until Bob comes online, but Alice doesn't need it to get started.
  
<h2>Sending a message</h2>

<p>If the binary is false, Alice sends a request to the server to send a message to Bob. The server sends Alice Bob's current <b>y*</b>. If this doesn't match <b>y</b> (or rather, its encryption), Alice decrypts <b>y*</b> using <b>y, x*</b> and updates keys:
<ul>
<li>She updates private <b>x = x*</b> and saves a new DH key pair to <b>x*</b>, checking to ensure it is distinct.
  <li>She updates public <b>y' = y</b> and then <b>y = y*</b>.
</ul>
Finally, she sends her message, encrypted with the shared encryption key <b>g^(xy) mod N</b>, including the public key <b>x*</b> in the encrypted message. She does likewise if the binary were true.

<p>If the <b>y*</b> is old however, she creates a new DH key pair with private key <b>r</b> and then encrypts her message using the shared encryption key <b>g^(ry) mod N</b>. As before, she includes the public key <b>x*</b> in the encrypted message. However, now she attaches the public key <b>r</b> encrypted with key <b>g^(xy) mod N</b>. Once sent, she immediately deletes <b>r</b>.


<h2>Receiving a message</h2>


<p>If there is an attached public key <b>r</b>, Bob decrypts the message using <b>x', y, r</b>. If the decryption succeeds, he sends a message to the server with his <b>y*</b>, encrypted with <b>g^(xy) mod N</b>.
  
<p>If there is no attachment, or the above decryption attempt fails, Bob decrypts using <b>x, y*</b> and updates keys:
<ul>
<li>He updates private <b>y = y*</b> and saves a new DH key pair to <b>y*</b>, checking to ensure it is distinct.
<li>He updates public <b>x' = x</b> and then <b>x = x*</b>.
</ul>
He sends a message to the server with his new <b>y*</b>, encrypted with <b>g^(xy) mod N</b>.

<p>Lastly, if there is no attachment and the above attempt fails, Bob decrypts using <b>x', y</b>.


<h2>Checks</h2>

Does the decryption ever fail? Consider first the decryption that occurs in the sending phase. The decryption only occurs if the public key of Bob's stored in the server is foreign to Alice. The server key is thus either older or newer than the key Alice has stored. Note that Alice's copy of Bob's key is strictly older than the server's, since Alice fetches her copy of Bob's key from the server itself (except in the case that Bob messages Alice directly, which we rule out via the binary). The server key thus must be newer than Alice's. Then, note that Bob only encrypts a newly generated key using a shared encryption key that Alice just used, so it is precisely "one step newer," as desired.

<p>Next, consider the receiving phase, where Bob receives a message with attachment. I claim the decryption uses the older keys except in the case of a lost or misordered message (so I attempt with the old keys first). Alice sends a message with attached <b>r</b> only if her <b>y</b> matches the server's copy of <b>y*</b>. Of course, the server's copy of <b>y*</b> is older than or equal to Bob's, so the <b>y</b> used to encrypt the message is likewise older than or equal to Bob's <b>y*</b>. Equality would mean that Bob's freshly generated <b>y*</b> somehow made its way to Alice. The binary rules out the case that it was through a direct message from Bob, so it was through the server. This means that a previous message from Alice had caused the update; this message from Alice should have instigated a key update on Bob's side - so it was either late or lost.

<p>With no attachment, a received message similarly uses newer keys except in the case of a lost or misordered message.
  
<p>Can the ratchet ever get stuck? Consider here only new messages (as opposed to very old misordered messages, which are not relevant to the question). Notice that all messages are sent with a newer public key within the encrypted message, so if the ratchet gets stuck, it's due to the receiving side. On the receiving side, a lack of update occurs only when 
<ul>
 <li> Bob has newer keys than what Alice is using to encrypt,
 <li>and Alice's messages have no attachment.
</ul>
<p>If Bob messages Alice, the first condition fails. Thus, suppose in addition that Bob is not messaging Alice. Then no attachments implies Alice is actively fetching from the server, advancing her keys.

<h2>Analysis</h2>

Strengths of this protocol, all improvements over the Signal protocol, in increasing significance:
<ul>
<li>This protocol is very robust against dropped or misordered messages, matching IDHEA.
  
<li>There are only two cryptographic primitives: DH and AES.
  
<li>Accordingly, there are no digital signatures. I haven't analyzed this but I'm sure there is some improvement in deniability as a result.
  
<li>There are no long term keys of any kind, so even authentication enjoys a kind of forward and future secrecy.
  
<li>Alice may remain entirely anonymous to the server. Every time she sends a message to Bob, there is no need for the server to know who she is. Further, this "Postal Diffie-Hellman" is carefully crafted so that Bob's insta-reply is directed to the server, not Alice (which would immediately give her away).
  
<li>As long as Bob is online to receive messages, Alice almost always uses new keys, on both her side and Bob's.
</ul>

In defense of some apparent weaknesses:
<ul>
<li>Why are there no long term or signed authentication keys? In practice, you need to deliberately go to a third party to verify an identity key one way or another, whether it is long term or not. (When I introduced the concept of long term keys, I presented the hypothetical of people "eventually chatting about their identity keys at the water cooler." This isn't very realistic.)
  
<li>What if Bob is not online to update his key for Alice? Alice certainly protects the forward and future secrecy of her own key via <b>r</b>, but Bob's key <b>y</b> is reused, as was the case with IDHEA. However, in the Signal protocol, if Bob is offline, his device must store the top key of his KDF chain, which is just as bad as storing <b>y</b>.
</ul>
