As I hinted at in my discussion of the Signal protocol, there are two things I did not like:

<ul>
<li> The one-time key idea used in the E3DH. This is too gimmicky for me.

<li> The Double Ratchet seems unnecessarily complicated, insisting on a KDF chain when a single Diffie-Hellman (DH) sequence would suffice, and in fact improve future secrecy.
</ul>

<p> My idea is to simplify the scheme into a Repeated Double Diffie-Hellman (R2DH) scheme, as follows:

  
 
  
<h2> Repeated Double Diffie-Hellman </h2>

For each of her successive messages, Alice will use an encryption key consisting of a fresh, random short-term DH key <b>x</b>, concatenated with her long-term key <b>a</b>, in the following sense:
<div class="media">
 <b>g^(ay) mod N</b> and <b>g^(xy) mod N</b>.
</div>
And that's pretty much it! Of course, she will attach the following to her message:

<ul>
  <li> The corresponding public key for <b>x</b> so Bob can build the shared key. 
   <li> She will also include which of Bob's public keys she used. As Bob will have provided her multiple short-term public keys <b>g^y mod N</b>, she will use the most recent one. As a result, Alice needs to store at most one of Bob's public keys at any time. 
<li>In her (encrypted) message, she also includes an integer specifying the number of this particular message, ie. its position in the list of messages she has sent. This serves the two-fold purpose of being useful information for Bob, but also as a recognizably non-random string in the decrypted message (the latter is useful for authentication).
  </ul>

<p>When Bob receives a message from Alice, there is no ambiguity as to which of his private keys he should use to decrypt it. After decrypting it, he sees the number of the message, and can determine if he is up to date with all of Alice's messages so far. If so, he can delete all of his short-term key pairs up to the one Alice just used.
  
 <p>If Bob sends a lot of messages before Alice replies, this is a lot of key pairs to store. However, assuming no lost messages or delays, Bob really needs only to store his most recent key pair. As a result, it is reasonable for Bob to store at most, say 16 key pairs.
   
<p> Regarding authentication, and protection against man-in-the-middle attacks: Recall that the initial DH requires Bob's posted short term public key to have an attached signature for asynchronous authentication. In contrast, Alice's short-term public key is verified as it is concatenated in the above sense with her authenticated long-term key (and the resulting shared key is tested by decrypting the message number). Similarly, all future keys are deniably authenticated by concatenation with authenticated long-term keys; no signatures needed.

  
<h2> Initialization</h2>

This would be the same as the usual R2DH step, except she would receive the public counterpart to <b>y</b> not from one of Bob's messages, but from the server. As a result, it needs to be digitally signed. Bob's signed <b>y</b> will refresh every time a new chat is initiated with him, if he is logged in. This is similar to the E3DH, but with systematic signed-key refresh instead of the optional one-time keys. 

<p> A remark: Signal appears to be contact-based, with infinite scroll, so initialization rarely happens. For ChatScrypt, the initialization procedure would repeat for each new chat, so refreshing the signed <b>y</b> would not be a rare event. (And if it is, then it's not often used in any case.)




<h2>Analysis</h2>

I am worried about this protocol because - to entirely put aside any humility - it is too good. It is vastly simpler than Signal's Double Ratchet Algorithm, and seems to be strictly more secure. It has identical deniability properties, as no signatures are used except at the outset, just as in the Signal protocol. Combined with the "Postal Delivery Model" of Part I, the ChatScrypt server can only possibly collect data about how much mail each user receives, with timestamps. It can know nothing about whom is talking to whom, or even when a new contact is initiated.

<p>Let me list the relative weaknesses I can think of right now, in increasing order of severity:
<ul>
    
<li> At initialization, I only have one short-term key, as opposed to multiple for E3DH. This compromises security in the very mild sense that if multiple people initiate chats with Bob while he is offline, they will all use the same public keys to build their shared DH encryption keys with Bob. They of course will use different private keys however, and so forward/future secrecy is preserved aside from the case of catastrophic RNG failure on Alice's side. (This is why multiple short-term keys was optional in E3DH to begin with.)
  
<li>I suspect KDF chains are faster, with smaller state, than having multiple DH pairs. But DH is pretty quick already, and as I pointed out last time, the Double Ratchet Algorithm actually should prefer that the DH-less KDF not run too long, as this damages future secrecy.
  
  <li>Why double instead of triple? Of course, this would cut overhead by a third. But is it as secure? Recall that two of three DH shared keys in E3DH are there mostly for authentication. As shared keys are never used more than once in this protocol, and in particular are one-way, there is only a need for one of the two authenticating shared keys. There is some lost security: For instance, stealing Bob's <b>y</b> alone would crack the example shared key above; in the triple version, <b>x</b> or <b>b</b> would need to be stolen as well. However, chances are, if <b>y</b> is stolen, <b>b</b> is as well, as they are both stored by Bob. (Of course, R2DH is easily extended to R3DH if someone convinces me of a good reason to do so.)
  
<li>The Signal protocol doesn't directly use long-term keys <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> for authentication in the double ratchet. Instead, it uses a successive DH-seeded hash of an E3DH-authenticated shared key. Since the authentication key is constantly refreshing, this makes man-in-the-middle attacks harder. (For R2DH, an attacker can slowly and passively cryptanalyze his/her way into <b>a</b> or <b>b</b>; rapidly refreshed authentication keys are too ephemeral for this.) On the other hand, this feature is a major reason why the Double Ratchet Algorithm is complicated by KDF chains: Alice can't be creating lots of new DH keys (which double as authentication seeds) without Bob acknowledging each one, since Bob cannot make sense of messages that are out of order. A KDF chain is the next best thing.
    
</ul>

In the next installment, Part III, I will try to make the best of both worlds for this last weakness.

<p>On the other hand, there are some relative strengths:
<ul>
<li> Bob updates his initialization short-term key more regularly.
  
<li> Here we easily keep the message number encrypted. The Signal protocol has a fairly complicated (though more secure) header encryption scheme that to my mind is mostly unnecessary.

<li> As already pointed out, for brief spurts in the Double Ratchet Algorithm, the KDF chains did not have satisfactory future secrecy. However, there is in principle an unbounded period of time with no future secrecy, if Bob refuses to reply to Alice. With R2DH, there is at least a weak future secrecy established on Alice's side due to the use of a fresh private key for every single message.
</ul>
