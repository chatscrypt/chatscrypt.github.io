I decided to carefully write out my third and hopefully final attempt at the protocol I will be using for ChatScrypt, a version of the AIDH protocol with four keys. This will be slightly different from how I ended the previous post, in that Alice will ask for permission to update her own keys, not Bob's. This is more efficient and deterministic, since Alice is the one controlling her own key generation.

<p>I will omit writing literal public keys <b>g^x mod N</b>, writing just "public key <b>x</b>" instead. Note that this is the <i>entire</i> protocol, right here, merging Signal's E3DH and Double Ratchet, simplifying both internally, and strictly improving security, as far as I can tell. Of course, these statements need some peer review.


<h2>Alice's state</h2>

<p>Once the protocol is initiated, Alice will have the following state variables:
<ul>
<li>Alice's current private key <b>x</b>, and pending private key <b>x*</b> waiting for confirmation from Bob.
<li>Bob's current public key <b>y</b>, and previous public key <b>y'</b> in case Alice has processed the update to <b>y</b>, but Bob is unaware and still sending <b>y'</b> encrypted messages.
</ul>


<h2>Initialization</h2>
Alice publishes to the server an unsigned but long-term public key <b>a</b>. Bob publishes to the server a new signed public key <b>y</b>. He refreshes this key every time he comes online, and while online, every time someone initiates a new correspondence with him.

<p>When Alice wants to initiate a correspondence with Bob, she fetches Bob's signed public key, verifies the signature, and initializes her state:
<ul>
<li>Alice sets <b>x = a</b> and saves a new Diffie-Hellman key pair to <b>x*</b>. She ensures that the new key is different from the old one (astronomically unlikely, but still).
<li>Both of Bob's public keys are set to <b>y</b>. 
</ul>

<p>Bob is similar, but with both private keys set to <b>y</b> and public keys set to <b>a</b>.



<h2>Sending a message</h2>
Alice creates a new Diffie-Hellman key pair with private key <b>r</b> and then encrypts her message using the shared Diffie-Hellman encryption keys 
<div class="media">
<b>g^(xy) mod N</b> and <b>g^(ry) mod N</b>.
</div>

She delivers her message with the following attachments:
<ul>
<li> (unencrypted) The public key <b>r</b>. 
<li> (encrypted) The public key <b>x*</b> (which may be kept entirely private for extra security).
</ul>

<h2>Receiving a message</h2>

If the incoming <b>x*</b> doesn't match Bob's <b>x</b>, Bob decrypts using <b>x, y*, r</b> and updates keys (actually, he tries decrypting blindly; success implies the inequality, as we discuss later):
<ul>
<li>Update private <b>y = y*</b> and save a new Diffie-Hellman key pair to <b>y*</b>. Ensure that the new key is different from the old one (astronomically unlikely).
  <li>Update public <b>x' = x</b> and then <b>x = x*</b>.
</ul>
If the incoming <b>x* = x</b>, Bob decrypts the message using <b>x', y, r</b> and does not update keys.


<h2>Dropped and misordered messages</h2>

There is some key deletion in the receiving phase; Bob needs to be sure it's safe to delete. Some terminology: A message which instigates key updates will be called an active message. 

<p>First let's verify that the decryption always works on active message receipt - where Bob uses his <b>x, y*, r</b> to decrypt, while Alice encrypted with <b>x, y, r</b>. Alice must have generated the included <b>x*</b> at some point; she generated it on an active message received from Bob, which she successfully decrypted. This successful (active) decrypt means her <b>x*</b> at that time matched Bob's <b>x</b>. She then pushed her <b>x*</b> to her <b>x</b>; thus Alice and Bob's <b>x</b>'s now match. Similarly, she pushed Bob's new <b>y*</b> to her <b>y</b>, so they match. Thus, the active decryption works - contingent on the fact that Bob did not change his keys in the meantime. 
  
<p>How could Bob have changed his keys? Only if Alice launched off a newer but speedier message arriving before the current one (in other words, a misorder). However, note that the newer message would have the same key properties, pushing the ratchet forward correctly, and preserving communications. Thus, we have some options:
  <ul>
<li>Bob can simply discard slow messages (the decryption would fail to yield a recognizable username).
<li>Bob can wait, proceeding only if messages are contiguous (Alice and Bob could each attach a counter of their own sent messages). This could be a problem for lost messages, as he would end up waiting indefinitely.
<li>Bob can also save some reasonable fixed number of old keys. Lost messages wouldn't hold up communications, and heavily delayed (ie. misordered) messages can be tossed, being as good as lost anyway.
</ul>
  
<p>Passive messages arriving between their proper active messages, can also always be decrypted. This is fairly easy to see. They similarly may be lost or misordered.

<h2>Analysis</h2>


<p>As discussed, these two implementations of AIDH are not better or worse than each other. They balance three things: 1. Authentication security (faster authentication key refresh), 2. message security (faster key deletion), and 3. robustness against dropped/misordered messages. AIDH 1.0 achieved 1 and 3, but was weak at 2, with potentially large numbers of keys stored. AIDH 2.0 achieves 2 and 3, but is slightly weaker at 1.
  
<p>There might be the possibility of a third implementation, which achieves 1 and 2 but is weak at 3. Here, the implementation would refuse to let Bob speak until he has read Alice's most recent message. This isn't great, as it's hard to prevent the very real case where Alice and Bob talk over each other. Then they both update their keys, and a fraction of a second later, they both receive messages they can't decrypt. Neither can authenticate the other, though in principle they can still communicate using the attached public keys in the messages.
  
<p>Edit (1/24/2020): Let me clarify the weakness of this current implementation. 
  
<p>The issue is that when Alice sends an active message, she has fixed for the time being the next key that Bob will use to authenticate her. An attacker wanting to masquerade as Alice would know this, and get to work cracking this key. For as long as Bob does not reply to her, this key is valuable, opening the way to a man-in-the-middle attack. Alice has no way to repair this; sending passive messages does not update her authentication key. 
  
<p>Note that in contrast, messages in AIDH 1.0 are never passive: If Alice is worried that someone is trying to crack one of her keys, or has stolen it, she can rectify this without input from Bob: She can simply secure her computer and then send another message. If Bob sees it, the candidate authentication key is refreshed and the old key under attack is essentially discarded. However, recall that the weakness with AIDH 1.0 was that key storage requirements are unbounded.
  
<p>I should point out that the Signal protocol suffers from both these weaknesses: Unbounded key storage as well as "delayed authentication key regeneration." It does have "perfect" robustness against dropped and misordered messages, but this last bit is somewhat of a wasted effort, because permitting dropped messages isn't really a desirable feature. I suppose with Signal, it might be, due to the intent to have "infinite scroll." But for ChatScrypt, it's very much optional.

<p>Edit (1/24/2020): Nevermind, AIDH 2.0 is better than AIDH 1.0 in the authentication regard as well. It's key deletion that matters, not key creation. By keeping a large list of keys in AIDH 1.0, Alice is allowing any one of them to "represent her"; an attacker needn't use the newest one, as I mistakenly thought above. The only advantage comes in the fact that Alice can choose to use Bob's newest key to encrypt. 

<p>So is there any reason to use AIDH 1.0? Kind of; in 2.0, Alice is forced to use Bob's "oldest" and least secure encryption key. But in a way, message security is not a concern with these ratcheting forward/future secret protocols: This is the whole point. The biggest risk is a man-in-the-middle attack. And in that sense, it seems that 2.0 is just marginally better (as discussed, there are strictly fewer keys which authenticate Alice at any time). So it looks like this ends the discussion on the AIDH protocol! Next, Part V, I'll discuss ambient security considerations, including primitives and key storage.

  
  
<p>Edit (1/29/2020): I simplified the protocol quite a bit, and improved security properties. I noticed something interesting: If Bob's device is compromised, and the <b>y</b> keys are all stolen from a period of time that doesn't date to the beginning of the communication, the messages are still secure. This is because the ratcheting <b>x</b>'s and <b>y</b>'s are entirely private, except at the initial exchange, where <b>x = a</b> and <b>y</b> have published public keys. Thus, AIDH 2.0 enjoys what one might call <i>two point</i> secrecy: An attacker would need to steal secrets belonging to <i>both</i> Alice and Bob to succeed, or Bob now and Bob past. 
  
<p>Admittedly, Alice is sending Bob her public keys <b>x</b> constantly. But, for instance, in the case of spontaneous failure or compromise of Bob's random number generator, the <b>x</b>'s could conceivably remain entirely private, along with the ciphertexts.
  
<p>Edit (1/30/2020): I've also noticed that there is the matter of knowing which key to use to decrypt a received message, if the sender is hidden. Publicly attached with the message could be a hash of the public key to use.
