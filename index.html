<p>The blog for the ChatScrypt project! Initiated in 2019, by a two non-expert but technically-educated developers, as a part-time late-night hobby (to give an idea about the rate of progress). Goals for the project:

<ul>
<li> A chat client featuring....

<li> zero-trust security, encryption, and transparency,

<li> over a user-friendly searchable chat transcript;

<li> speed and simplicity,

<li> over a highly customizable platform;

<li> portability across multiple devices and platforms.
</ul>

Chatscrypt = chat + encryption + transcription.
